Using the BDSS: The Workflow Manager
====================================

The Workflow Manager allows the user to easily construct a graph of functions,
optimize this graph and view the results graphically. A number of terms are specific
to the BDSS and the Workflow Manager or otherwise have a specific meaning within them.

**Workflow**
    The directed graph of functions that models a process.

**Data source**
    A node (function) in the graph (workflow).

**Data value**
    An input or output of a node (data source).

**Parameter**
    An input of the graph (workflow) and how that input should be treated (as a numerical or categorical variable, etc: see below).

**Key performance indicator (KPI)**
    An output (criterion or objective) of the graph (workflow).

**MCO**.
    Multi-criterion optimizer.
